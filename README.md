# ReservationFinder

This program was designed to help find appealing restaurant reservations more easily. This program queries for reservations on OpenTable 
based on user-provided input and cross-references the results with Yelp. The program then returns available reservations for restaurants with 4+ stars on Yelp.

The program utilizes a GUI to solicit the user's input and to return the search results.
